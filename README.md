This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6. The issue is that nested routes are not rendering correctly. The nested route component does not render when navigating to the nested path, instead showing the parent component's content. This is due to a misuse of the Routes and Route components in React Router v6. The solution is to properly nest the Routes components within each parent Route component.
